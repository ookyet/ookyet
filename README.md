## What is **ookyet**?

**ookyet** is a personal framework and a verified Web3 identity operated by Qifeng Huang.  
It anchors a **brand-first** digital self across platforms with public, auditable evidence.

**One-line**: *A verifiable digital identity built on ENS, NFT, and social unification.*

### Identity pillars
- **ENS**: `ookyet.eth`
- **NFT avatar**: *Lil Ghost #761* (publicly verifiable)
- **Sovereign website**: <https://ookyet.com>  
  - **Identity Proof** hub consolidating on-chain & off-chain evidence  
  - **Verified Gallery** with live links and snapshots

---

## Verification architecture (at a glance)

- **On-chain anchors**  
  Ownership of the ENS domain (`ookyet.eth`) and the NFT avatar is public and traceable.

- **Off-chain consistency**  
  The *ookyet* handle and avatar are used consistently across major social platforms.

- **Sovereign verification hub**  
  <https://ookyet.com/proof> provides a single, auditable place to verify identity elements.

- **Web3 credentials (optional layer)**  
  Dentity credentials link personhood to the ENS identity in a privacy-respecting way.

> The design keeps core identity constant and platform-agnostic.

## Principles

> **The way we see, and what we do next.**  
A two-part cadence for turning perception into reality. The identity exists to keep creation
and verification aligned over time.

---

## Status & scope

This is a personal, non-commercial identity project focused on **long-term consistency**,
**public verifiability**, and **minimal surface for ambiguity** across the open web.
